My name is Vendela Lundgren, and I am a 2023 graduate of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I earned a double major in Geography and Environmental Systems, and Economics. I am currently seeking opportunities in the sciences that will allow me to apply—and build upon—my undergraduate research and experience in environmental science.

During my academic career, I developed a strong interest in urban planning, infrastructure development, and hydrology, particularly through the lens of environmental science and geospatial information systems (GIS). I am passionate about using GIS and data science to enhance infrastructure across diverse geographies and to inform regulatory frameworks. In the near future, I plan to pursue a master’s degree in environmental science to deepen my expertise and continue contributing to research in an academic setting.

If you are interested in learning more about my work or discussing how I might contribute to your organization or project, please feel free to contact me. I would be honored to collaborate and support your goals.
