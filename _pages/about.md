excerpt: "About me"

My name is Vendela Lundgren, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am pursuing two B.A.'s in Economics and Geography and Environmental Systems, and I am set to graduate in the Fall of 2023. In the following years, I hope to pursue graduate school abroad to further my studies and broaden my horizons.

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong interest in environmental science, economic geography, GIS, econometrics, and finance, which have allowed me to gain experience in using various software programs, such as ArcGIS, QGIS, R, Excel, SAP, and Stata. My primary focus is on equitable finance, which is to better sustainable investing and create a standard in finance that holds businesses accountable for their socio-spatial and environmental impacts while still taking profit into consideration.

I am interested in investment and portfolio management, private equity and environmental studies/advocacy, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas. Whether it's academic research on economic geography, organizing a sustainability department or basic accounting, I am committed to making a positive impact for the future of our environment through finance. 

If you're interested in learning more about my work, or if you'd like to discuss how I can contribute to your organization or project, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would be honored to work with you and to help you achieve success in your endeavors. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
